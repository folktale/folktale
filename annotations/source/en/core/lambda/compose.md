Composes two functions.


## Example::

    const compose = require('folktale/core/lambda/compose');

    const inc       = (x) => x + 1;
    const double    = (x) => x * 2;
    const incDouble = compose(double, inc);

    incDouble(3);
    // ==> 8


## Why Composition Matters?

Composition is a way of creating new functionality by combining
existing functionality. It helps managing complexity in software
projects, since newer functionality can be defined in terms of
existing ones, reducing both the amount of code needed to implement
newer features, and the amount of time one needs to spend to understand
them.

This technique is used very often in regular JavaScript code, when
we feed the results of a function into another function::

    const names = [
      'Alissa', 'Max', 'Talib'
    ];
    const upcase = (name) => name.toUpperCase();

    names.map(upcase).join(', ');
    // ==> 'ALISSA, MAX, TALIB'

Here `names` is fed into the `map` function, which returns an array
of the same names in capitals. This new array is then fed into the
`join` function, which returns a String where the items are separated
by a comma.

If we need to use `.map(upcase).join(', ')` in a lot of places, it
makes sense to create a new function that captures that composition,
so we don't have to type it everywhere::

    const showNames = (names) =>
      names.map(upcase).join(', ');

Now we can use `showNames` instead of `.map(upcase).join(', ')`, and
we get the same functionality::

    showNames(names);
    // ==> 'ALISSA, MAX, TALIB'


## The Problem With Methods in JavaScript

JavaScript is a hybrid language, where you can express programs by
using object oriented techniques, functional programming techniques,
and some other paradigms. It's not uncommon to see parts of a program
expressed in OOP, as in the examples from the previous section.

However, objects in JavaScript can't be safely extended. Ideally, we'd
like to write:

    names.show();

Instead of:

    showNames(names);

Which would be more consistent with the rest of the program. Because
this involves mutating the array, all sorts of problems could happen
so it's better to keep the new functionality as a separate function.

Expressing things in functional programming doesn't have this problem
because functions exist on their own, rather than being part of an
object.


## Composition in Functional Programming

In functional programming, functions are the basic building block,
and we compose functions to create bigger things. To do this, we often
have to rephrase the common method calls in terms of regular functions::

    const names = [
      'Alissa', 'Max', 'Talib'
    ];

    const upcase = (name) => name.toUpperCase();
    const map    = (transform, items) => items.map(transform);
    const join   = (separator, items) => items.join(separator);

With this we can express the composition in terms of regular function
calls::

    const showNames = (names) =>
      join(', ', map(upcase, names));

    showNames(names);
    // ==> 'ALISSA, MAX, TALIB'

Now, while the way this program expresses its functions is consistent,
we still have to move the whole expression into the function, and
our code is not as easy to follow as before. Rather than reading from
left to right, we have to first read the inside of a function application
before we read what's outside of it.

These issues are not a problem with simple expressions such as these,
and most of the expressions in functional programming tend to be very
simple. But we can improve this by abstracting over the idea of
composition. That is, instead of requiring syntactic composition, by
having people write out the whole expression, we can ask the program
to combine these functions for us. This is what the `compose` function
does::

    const compose = require('folktale/core/lambda/compose');

    const showNames2 = compose(
      capitals => join(', ', capitals),
      names    => map(upcase, names)
    );

Instead of reading from inside of a complex expression to the outside,
now you can read each expression on its own, and visualise the flow of
data linearly.

> applied first. You can use the `infix` version of compose to avoid
> this.


## Currying and Composition

Composing unary functions is trivial, as seen on the first example
of this documentation::

    const compose = require('folktale/core/lambda/compose');

    const inc       = (x) => x + 1;
    const double    = (x) => x * 2;
    const incDouble = compose(double, inc);

But composing functions that take more than one argument doesn't read
as naturally::

    const upcase = (name) => name.toUpperCase();
    const map    = (transform, items) => items.map(transform);
    const join   = (separator, items) => items.join(separator);

    const showNames = compose(
      capitals => join(', ', capitals),
      names    => map(upcase, names)
    );

The problem is that `compose` can only safely compose unary functions,
so you have to do some additional work to place the values in the
"right places" when your function takes more than one argument.

One way to solve this problem is to curry the functions that will be
composed. That is, turn a function of arity N, into N functions of
arity 1::

    const upcase2 = (name) => name.toUpperCase();
    const map2    = (transform) => (items) => items.map(transform);
    const join2   = (separator) => (items) => items.join(separator);

    const showNames2 = compose(join2(', '), map2(upcase2));

Note that with a small change to how `map` and `join` are defined, we
can make a much better use of the `compose` function. This is not
without its drawbacks, however, as now `join` has to be called as
`join(',')(names)`.

Another way to work around this problem is by using the `partialize`
function provided by Folktale. This function creates a new function
that specifies only parts of the argument for the original function::

    const partialize = require('folktale/core/lambda/partialize');
    const _          = partialize.hole;

    const upcase3 = (name) => name.toUpperCase();
    const map3    = partialize(2, (transform, items) => items.map(transform));
    const join3   = partialize(2, (separator, items) => items.join(separator));

    const showNames3 = compose(
      join3(', ', _),
      map3(upcase, _)
    );

See `folktale/core/lambda/partialize` for more information on how the
`partialize` function works.


## Composing More Than Two Functions

The `compose` operation is limited to composing only two functions.
This might sound limiting, but it ensures that function composition
is well-defined.

Because a lot of functions in JavaScript are expected to be variadic,
and just ignore the additional parameters, you'd get some very
surprising behaviour when trying to pass `compose` to them. For example,
the following would throw a type error:

    const compose = require('folktale/core/lambda/compose');

    const inc    = (x) => x + 1;
    const double = (x) => x * 2;
    const square = (x) => x * x;

    [inc, double, square].reduce(compose)(3);
    // ==> throws TypeError: '1 is not a function'

Because it's equivalent to:

    const fns = [inc, double, square];
    compose(
      compose(
        square,
        double,
        1,
        fns
      ),
      inc
      0,
      fns
    )(3);


If you need to compose more than two functions, you can use the
`infix` syntax, or the `all` convenience function.


### Composition With The Infix Syntax

With the [This-Binding syntax][es-bind] proposed for JavaScript, it's
possible to compose multiple functions in an, arguably, more natural way::

     const compose = require('folktale/core/lambda/compose');

     const then  = compose.infix;
     const inc   = (x) => x + 1;
     const plus4 = inc::then(inc)::then(inc)::then(inc);

     plus4(2);
     // ==> 6


### Composition With The `all` Function

If you need to compose more than two functions, you might consider using
the `all` convenience function instead, which is variadic::

    const compose = require('folktale/core/lambda/compose');

    const inc   = (x) => x + 1;
    const plus4 = compose.all(inc, inc, inc, inc);

    plus4(2);
    // ==> 6

Composition with the `all` convenience still happens from right to left.

Conveniently composes function with the This-Binding syntax.

This is a free-method version of `compose` that applies the `this`
argument first, then the function it takes as argument. It's meant
to be used with the [This-Binding Syntax][es-bind] proposal.

    const then   = compose.infix;
    const inc    = (x) => x + 1;
    const double = (x) => x * 2;

    inc::then(double)(2);  // ==> 6

Conveniently composes multiple functions.

Because `compose` is limited to two functions, composing more than that
is awkward::

    const compose = require('folktale/core/lambda/compose')

    const inc    = (x) => x + 1;
    const double = (x) => x * 2;
    const square = (x) => x * x;

    const incDoubleSquare = compose(inc, compose(double, square));
    incDoubleSquare(3);
    // ==> 19

In these cases one may use `compose.all`, which is a variadic convenience
for composing multiple functions::

    const incDoubleSquare2 = compose.all(inc, double, square);
    incDoubleSquare2(3);
    // ==> 19
