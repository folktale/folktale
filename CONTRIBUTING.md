## How can I contribute to Folktale?

Here are some ways in which you can contribute to the Folktale community:

  - Join the [Gitter Channel][gitter] and ask and/or answer questions. Folktale
    aims to be usable by people new to FP, so by asking questions and sharing
    your troubles with the library, you're helping us get closer to that goal.

  - Talk about Folktale. By bloggging, writing tutorials, or giving talks in
    your local JS community. A bigger and healthy community helps by really
    putting the libraries to test.

  - [Report bugs](#reporting-bugs) in our [GitHub issue tracker][issues], or
    [request new features](#requesting-features).

  - [Submit patches](#adding-or-fixing-code) for new features, or to fix existing
    bugs. Take a look at the list of [Good First Issues](https://waffle.io/origamitower/folktale?label=e:Good%20First%20Issue)
    if you're not entirely sure where to start.

  - [Improve existing documentation](#adding-or-fixing-documentation).


## Reporting bugs

Use the [GitHub issue tracker][issues] to report any errors you find in Folktale. This also includes things like the documentation not being clear enough. If you're not sure about how to report a bug, [follow the Bug Reporting guide](http://origamitower.github.io/folktale/api/en/guides.reporting-bugs.html).


## Requesting features

Folktale doesn't do everything, so more often than not you'll find something
that you wish Folktale supported but that isn't implemented yet. Maybe the
thought has never crossed our minds. This is a great opportunity to
[tell us about that feature you want](https://github.com/origamitower/folktale/issues/new). Check out the [Requesting Features guide](http://origamitower.github.io/folktale/api/en/guides.requesting-new-features.html) if you're not sure how to format your request, or if a feature fits Folktale.


## Adding or fixing tests

Folktale uses a mix of property-based and unit tests. [Read the Test Writing guide](http://origamitower.github.io/folktale/api/en/guides.improving-folktale-s-tests.html) to understand how to add new tests, or update existing ones.


## Adding or fixing documentation

Found a typo in the documentation, or think that something is missing from it, and want to help fixing that? [Read the Documentation Writing guide](http://origamitower.github.io/folktale/api/en/guides.improving-folktale-s-documentation.html) to understand how.


## Adding or fixing code

[Read the Code Writing guide](http://origamitower.github.io/folktale/api/en/guides.contributing-code.html) if you want to fix a bug in Folktale or implement a new feature.
