 * Folktale is a library for functional programming in JavaScript. It provides
 * combinators and data structures that make it easier to write programs by
 * composing existing features to build bigger things, which can be further
 * composed.
 *
 * > **TODO**  
 * > This documentation is a stub and needs to be improved. It should give
 * > pointers on where to start on functional programming and Folktale.
