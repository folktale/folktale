 * Constructs a sum data structure.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 *     const List = data({
 *       Nil: [],
 *       Cons: ['head', 'tail']
 *     });
 *
 *     const { Nil, Cons } = List;
 *     let abc = new Cons({
 *       head: 'a',
 *       tail: new Cons({
 *         head: 'b',
 *         tail: new Cons({
 *           head: 'c',
 *           tail: new Nil()
 *         })
 *       })
 *     });
 *
 *
 * It's recommended to provide wrappers for the constructors:
 *
 *     const cons = (head, tail) => new Cons({ head, tail });
 *     const nil  = _ => new Nil();
 *
 *     let abc = cons('a', cons('b', cons('c', nil())));
 *
 *
 * ## Why?
 *
 * JavaScript, as most languages, only really supports product types
 * out of the box. This means that we can easily model data structures that
 * are a composition of several independent pieces of data, however it also
 * means that as soon as we need to model a different kind of data structure,
 * like one where the fields vary depending on its type, we're on our own.
 *
 * For correctly modelling something, we usually want to have both product
 * (the composition of independent pieces of data) and sum (a choice between
 * one of many possibilities) types. This module provides the missing *sum*
 * support for JavaScript.
 *
 *
 * ## Architecture
 *
 * In most cases, one would ideally want a closed sum (that is, once you
 * construct an ADT, there's no way of changing the variants that are part
 * of it). JavaScript is an untyped language, however, so that doesn't make
 * much of a sense to begin with.
 *
 * Because of this, the ADT module approaches the problem in a structural-type-ish
 * way, which happens to be very similar to how different values are handled in
 * unityped languages to begin with. In essence, calling `data` with a set
 * of patterns results in the creation of N constructors, each with a distinct
 * **tag**. The constructors accept an object as their only argument, and will
 * extract the fields that are relevant to that variant to initialise its state.
 *
 * Revisiting the previous `List` ADT example, we can see this by just looking
 * at its return value:
 *
 *     const List = data({
 *       Nil: [],
 *       Cons: ['head', 'tail']
 *     });
 *
 * Would expand to:
 *
 *     const List = Object.create(ADT);
 *
 *     List.Nil = function() { };
 *     List.Nil.prototype = Object.create(List);
 *     List.Nil.prototype.tag = 'Nil';
 *     List.Nil.prototype.fields = [];
 *
 *     List.Cons = function(data) {
 *       this.head = data.head;
 *       this.tail = data.tail;
 *     }
 *     List.Cons.prototype = Object.create(List);
 *     List.Cons.prototype.tag = 'Cons';
 *     List.Cons.prototype.fields = ['head', 'tail'];
 *
 * Furthermore, each variant gets a `cata` method for free. This method
 * implements a kind of structural transformation (*catamorphism*) that
 * is similar to a limited form of pattern matching:
 *
 *     const list = new Cons({ head: 1, tail: new Nil() });
 *
 *     const sum = (list) =>
 *       list.cata({
 *         Nil : _                => 0,
 *         Cons: ({ head, tail }) => head + sum(tail)
 *       });
 *
 *
 * ## Reflection and extension
 *
 * Structures created by the ADT module are reflective, so one can use the
 * exposed information for meta-programming at runtime. One of the uses for
 * this is providing a particular set of behaviours automatically for the
 * structure — a process we call “derivation”. Things like `equality` or
 * `serialisation` become pretty simple to do automatically, and relieve
 * the burden on the user.
 *
 * Each ADT comes with a [[derive]] method, which will take one or more
 * derivation functions and apply them to each variant in the structure.
 * This makes it easy to implement derivations that work across all of
 * the variants at once.
 *
 * Another approach is to attach methods to the ADT namespace itself, since
 * all variants inherit from it. If you were to implement something like
 * the `cata` operation, for example, you could do so as follows:
 *
 *     const List = data({
 *       Nil: [],
 *       Cons: ['head', 'tail']
 *     });
 *
 *     List.match = function(pattern) {
 *       pattern[this.tag](this)
 *     }
 *
 *     const head = (list) => list.match({
 *       Nil : _          => 'Nils have no head',
 *       Cons: ({ head }) => head
 *     });
 *
 *     head(new Nil());
 *     // => 'Nils have no head'
 *
 *     head(new Cons({ head: 1, tail: new Nil() }));
 *     // => 1
 *
 *
 * ## Membership testing
 *
 * Most of the time, it's a good idea to use structural equivalence and
 * the `catamorphism` operation to deal with transformations on ADT
 * structures. The dynamic dispatch in JavaScript will make sure that
 * the right operations are invoked for you, with no work necessary
 * in your part, and you don't risk any problems with Realms and other
 * concepts that might give you different instances of the same object.
 *
 * Sometimes, however, it might be desirable to test if a variant
 * belongs to a particular tagged union. ADT itself doesn't provide
 * any method for this, but since variants inherit from the ADT
 * namespace, you can use JavaScript's native `.isPrototypeOf`
 * operation to test for this:
 *
 *     const ListA = data({
 *       Nil: [],
 *       Cons: ['head', 'tail']
 *     });
 *
 *     const ListB = data({
 *       Nil: [],
 *       Cons: ['head', 'tail']
 *     });
 *
 *     const b = new ListB.Nil();
 *
 *     ListA.isPrototypeOf(b);
 *     // => false
 *
 *     ListB.isPrototypeOf(b);
 *     // => true

   * Allows a function to provide functionality to variants in an ADT.
   *
   * The `derive` method exists to support meta-programming on ADT objects,
   * such that additional functionality (implementation of interfaces or
   * protocols, for example) may be provided by libraries instead of having
   * to be hand-coded by the user.
   *
   * The operation accepts many `derivation` functions, which will be invoked
   * for each variant in the ADT, where a Variant is just an object with the
   * following attributes:
   *
   *     interface Variant {
   *       name        : String,
   *       constructor : Constructor,
   *       prototype   : Object,
   *       fields      : [String]
   *     }
   *
   * A derivation function can then use this information to include new
   * operations on the variant. For example, a JSON derivation could be
   * implemented as follows:
   *
   *     const ToJSON = (variant, adt) => {
   *       const fields = variant.fields;
   *       const tag = variant.name;
   *       variant['toJSON'] = function() {
   *         const json = { tag: tag };
   *         fields.forEach(k => json[k] = this[k]);
   *         return json;
   *       }
   *     }
   *
   * And used as such:
   *
   *     const List = data({
   *       Nil: [],
   *       Cons: ['head', 'tail']
   *     }).derive(ToJSON);
   *
   *     new List.Nil().toJSON()
   *     // => { tag: 'Nil' }
   *
   *     new List.Cons({ head: 1, tail: new List.Nil() })
   *     // => { tag: 'Cons', head: 1, tail: { tag: 'Nil' }}
