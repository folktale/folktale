# This file describes meta-data associated with Git commits
# that can be processed by tools.
#
# See <https://github.com/elliottcable/.gitlabels>

# --[ Nature of the change ]-------------------------------------------
# These labels give a summary of the kind of change that was made.
# They may be combined, although it's usually better to have separated
# commits introducing them.

- (new)               Introduces new functionality or features.
- (rm remove)         Removes previous functionality.
- (fix)               Fixes the behaviour of exiting features.
- (perf performance)  Introduces performance optimisations.
- (re refactor)       Changes structure, but doesn't introduce new features nor fixes bugs.


# --[ Qualifiers ]-----------------------------------------------------
# Changes may be qualified

- (!! important)  The commit introduces substantial changes.
- (break)         The change breaks an existing feature
- (- minor)       The change is rather minor and may be ignored in most cases
- (release)       A new public release


# --[ Scopes ]---------------------------------------------------------
# Because this is a multi-package repository, sometimes changes apply
# to only a few of these scopes. These labels exist for that reason

- (doc documentation)     Changes to API or other docs
- (test)                  Changes to test files
- (base)                  Changes to the Base package
- (other)                 Changes to other things (tooling, metadata)
