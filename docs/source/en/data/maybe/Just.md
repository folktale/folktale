category: Variants
---

Constructs a Maybe value that represents a successful value (a `Just`).

> **NOTE**:  
> The provided value is stored as-given in the structure. If you want to
> convert a nullable value (a value that may be null/undefined) to a Maybe
> value, use the `Maybe.fromNullable(value)` function instead of 
> `Maybe.Just(value)`.

See the documentation for the Maybe structure to understand how to use this.
