Provides utilities to define tagged unions.


## Programming with Tagged Unions

Modelling data is important for a range of reasons. From performance
to correctness to safety. Tagged unions give you a way of modelling
choices that forces the correct handling of them, unlike predicate-based
branching, such as the one used by if statements and other common 
control flow structures.

Most of the structures provided by Folktale are tagged unions. But
Folktale also gives you a primitive for constructing new ones in an
easy way. The `data` function provided by this module achieves that
goal::

    const data = require('folktale/core/adt/data');
    
    const Maybe = data('Maybe', {
      Some(value){ return { value } },
      None() { return {} }
    });

    Maybe.Some(1).matchWith({
      Some: ({ value }) => `Found ${value}`,
      None: ()          => "Not found" 
    });
    // ==> "Found 1"

Tagged unions constructed by this module allow one to easily bestow
common functionality in them through the `derive` function. For example,
one could add the concept of equality to the `Maybe` data structure
constructed previously by using the `Setoid` derivation, which is also
provided by this module::

    const Setoid = require('folktale/core/adt/setoid');
    Maybe.derive(Setoid);

    Maybe.Some(1).equals(Maybe.Some(1)); // ==> true
    Maybe.Some(2).equals(Maybe.Some(1)); // ==> false

These structures also provide a way of testing if a value belongs to
an ADT in a cross-realm way using the `.hasInstance` method on the ADT
or variant::

    Maybe.hasInstance(Maybe.None());       // ==> true
    Maybe.Some.hasInstance(Maybe.None());  // ==> false
    Maybe.Some.hasInstance(Maybe.Some(1)); // ==> true

See the documentation on the `data` function for details.


## What's in Core.ADT?

Core.ADT provides features to construct tagged unions, and common
derivations for those structures. These operations are divided as
follows:

  - **Constructing Data Structures**: functions that construct new
  tagged unions.

  - **Extending ADTs**: functions that allow one to extend existing
  ADTs and variants with new functionality.

  - **Derivation**: functions that can be used as derivations to
  provide common functionality to ADTs.
