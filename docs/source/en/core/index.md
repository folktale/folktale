Provides essential functionality for functional programs.


## What's in Core?

This module provides a range of features that are often used as
foundational building blocks in functional programming. It also
provides features for handling some common built-in JavaScript
structures in a functional way.

The operations are divided as follows:

  - **Modelling Data**: The Core.ADT module provides an
    implementation of Tagged Unions with limited pattern matching.
    This can be used to model your application's data more accurately,
    and thus make it harder to misuse that data;

  - **Combining Functions**: The Core.Lambda module provides
    operations on functions that allow combining functions together
    (like `compose`) or changing how you apply functions (like `curry`
    or `partialise`);

  - **Working with Objects as Dictionaries**: The Core.Object module
    provides operations that let you treat regular JavaScript objects
    as dictionaries. Several JavaScript APIs expect that usage of
    objects, but the built-in operations don't support  this well,
    so the Core.Object module addresses that.

  - **Writing generic code with Fantasy-Land**: The Core.FantasyLand
    module takes care of the differences in the various versions of
    the Fantasy Land spec, so you can write generic code that supports
    many libraries implementing any version of the spec.
