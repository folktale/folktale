Transforms functions of arity N into a chain of N unary functions


## Example::

    const curry = require('folktale/core/lambda/curry');

    const property = curry(2, (key, object) => object[key]);
    const people = [
      { name: 'Alissa', age: 26 },
      { name: 'Max',    age: 19 },
      { name: 'Talib',  age: 28 }
    ];

    people.map(property('name'));
    // ==> ['Alissa', 'Max', 'Talib']



## What is "Currying"?

Currying is the process of transforming a function that takes N arguments
all at once, into a series of functions that take one argument at a time.
This makes it possible to construct new funcionality by specialising part
of the arguments.

For example, the `property` function takes two arguments: the object that
contains the property, and the name of the property to retrieve::

    const property = (object, key) => object[key];

Because of this, every time someone call `property` they must provide both
arguments::

    property({ greeting: 'Hi' }, 'greeting');
    // ==> 'Hi'

Some of the time, you only have some of the arguments, however. For example,
if you wanted to create a function that always gets the `greeting` of a
particular object, you would have to do so manually::

    const greeting = (object) => property(object, 'greeting');

    greeting({ greeting: 'Hi' });
    // ==> 'Hi'

Currying alleviates the need for constructing these functions manually. If
`property` was curried, you'd be able to create a new `greeting` function
by just specifying some of the arguments, like you would do when invoking
the function::

    const property2 = (key) => (object) => object[key];
    const greeting2 = property2('greeting');

    greeting({ greeting: 'Hi' });

Note that the way we use arguments in a curried function is slightly
different. When designing a function to be curried, you should consider
which parameters are most likely to be fixed, and which parameters will
be provided afterwards. In this case, it's much more likely for someone
to have the name of a property than it is for them to have the object
in which that property lives::

    const score = [{ type: 'win' }, { type: 'draw' }];
    score.map(property2('type'));
    // ==> ['win', 'draw']


## Why Use Currying?

Functional programming places a heavy emphasis on function composition,
but sometimes we have functions that don't exactly fit the places we
want to use them. For example, `Array.prototype.map` expects a function
that takes three arguments:

    type Array.prototype.map =
      Array<'element> . (
        ('element, index is Number, Array<'element>) => 'newElement
      ) => Array<'newElement>

That is, given an array of of some `element` type, our callback, which
receives not only this `element`, but also the index of that element in
the array, and even the original array, is supposed to return a `newElement`
to put in the old element's place.

We can use `Array.prototype.map` to easily transform the data in the
array by some function. To expand a bit on the initial example, suppose
we have an array of people::

    const people = [
      { name: 'Alissa', age: 26, pronoun: 'she'  },
      { name: 'Max',    age: 19, pronoun: 'they' },
      { name: 'Talib',  age: 28, pronoun: 'he'   }
    ];

And then you want to get the name of one of those people. We can use
`Array.prototype.map` for this::

    people.map((element, index, array) => element.name);
    // ==> ['Alissa', 'Max', 'Talib']


> **NOTE**  
> Because functions in JavaScript are variadic, you don't need to
> create a function with three parameters here. The following code
> is strictly equivalent::
>
>     people.map(person => person.name);
>     // ==> ['Alissa', 'Max', 'Talib']


This is all well and good, because this is the only place where we use
this kind of functionality. But what if we have very similar functionality
in more places. For example, just like we got the names of these people,
we could get their ages::

    people.map(person => person.age);
    // ==> [26, 19, 28]

Or the pronoun they use::

    people.map(person => person.pronoun);
    // ==> ['she', 'they', 'he']

At this point, we're duplicating this functionality in many places. It
would be more productive to move it to a function we can reuse. And this
is easy enough:

    const property = (object, key) => object[key];

But this attempt is not really a good one in this case. Now composing
things is even more trouble:

    people.map(person => property(person, 'name'));

Ideally, we'd want:

    people.map(property);

But `property` takes two arguments, and `Array.prototype.map` can only
provide one of them: the object we should retrieve the property from.
Where do we get the other one from? Well, the name of the property is
static. We know exactly what we need from the callsite.

As said in the previous section, thinking about which arguments are likely
to be specified, and what aren't is important when designing curried
functions. For this case, we want to specialise the `key`, and leave
`object` to be provided by some other piece of code::

     const property = (key) => (object) => object[key];

     people.map(property('name'));
     // ==> ['Alissa', 'Max', 'Talib']

     people.map(property('age'));
     // ==> [26, 19, 28]

     people.map(property('pronoun'));
     // ==> ['she', 'they', 'he'] 

So, with currying, it becomes much simpler to shape a function so it
fits the expectations of the place where you want to use it. It alleviates
the need of making this translation manually, but it also requires some
prior thought on how these functions are likely to be used.


## How Folktale's `curry` Works?

The `curry` operation makes it simpler to construct curried functions
that work well with JavaScript, where functions may, and often do, take
more than one argument.

Consider the following example::

    const joinedBy = (separator) => (list) => (item) =>
      list.concat([separator, item]);

It's a curried function that takes 3 arguments, one at a time. To invoke
it one must do so like this::

    joinedBy(',')(['a'])('b');
    // ==> ['a', ',', 'b']

This makes it harder to use it for functions that pass two arguments to
their callbacks, like `Array.prototype.reduce`, because JavaScript passes
them all at once:

    ['b'].reduce(joinedBy(','), ['a']);
    // ==> [<function>, <function>]

This is where `curry` helps. It allows you to curry functions, while
unrolling application of more than one argument::

    const curry = require('folktale/core/lambda/curry');

    const joinedBy2 = curry(3, (separator, list, item) =>
      list.concat([separator, item]) 
    );

    joinedBy2(',', ['a'], 'b');
    // ==> ['a', ',', 'b']

    ['b'].reduce(joinedBy2(','), ['a']);
    // ==> ['a', ',', 'b']


## `curry`, Under The Hood

How can `curry` construct functions that support such different styles
of passing arguments? The secret is in how `curry` does unrolling. A
function constructed by `curry` takes two arguments:

1. The number of arguments that are expected for that function (arity);
2. The function that should be called when those arguments are collected.

In return, `curry` gives you back a function that, at first, only collects
arguments. That is, until we reach the amount of arguments expected (arity),
applying the `curry`ed function gives you back a new function that you
continue to apply::

    const curry = require('folktale/core/lambda/curry');

    const f = curry(4, (a, b, c, d) => [a, b, c, d]);

    // Previous arguments: []
    const f1 = f();
    // New arguments:      []

    // Previous arguments: []
    const f2 = f1(1);
    // New arguments:      [1]

    // Previous arguments: [1]
    const f3 = f2(2, 3);
    // New arguments:      [1, 2, 3]

    // Previous arguments: [1, 2, 3]
    f3(4);
    // ==> [1, 2, 3, 4]
    
The curried function keeps track of these arguments in an internal array.
This array is not modified when you apply a curried function. Instead, you
get a new function with a separate "internal arguments array"::

    // Previous arguments: [1]
    const f2_a = f2(4);  // => [1, 4]
    const f2_b = f2(5);  // => [1, 5]

    f2_a(5, 6); // ==> [1, 4, 5, 6]
    f2_b(5, 6); // ==> [1, 5, 5, 6]

Once the curried function has collected all of the arguments it needs to,
it "unrolls" the application. That is, it provides the arguments collected
to the original function::

    const plus  = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;
    const plus2 = curry(3, plus);

        plus2(1)(2)(3)
    === plus2(1, 2)(3)
    === plus2(1, 2, 3)
    === plus(1, 2, 3)
    === 1 + 2 + 3;
    
What happens if a curried function receives more arguments than it expects,
though? If the wrapped function is a regular JavaScript function, it's the
same. `curry` passes all of the arguments to it, and because JavaScript
functions are variadic, those additional arguments get (usually) ignored::

        plus2(1)(2)(3, 4, 5)
    === plus2(1, 2)(3, 4, 5)
    === plus2(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    === plus(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    === 1 + 2 + 3;

If the wrapped function is itself a curried function, things get more
interesting though, because the curried functio will, itself, unroll
the rest of the application!
::

    const subtract = curry(2, (x, y) => x - y);
    const flip     = curry(3, (f, x, y) => f(y, x));

        subtract(1)(2)
    === subtract(1, 2)
    === 1 - 2;

        flip(subtract)(1)(2)
    === flip(subtract, 1)(2)
    === flip(subtract, 1, 2)
    === subtract(2, 1)
    === 2 - 1;

Unrolling makes it possible to compose curried functions naturally, without
getting in the way of regular JavaScript functions.

## Drawbacks of Using `curry`

While `curry` certainly helps composing functions, it's important to note
that, because a lot of functions in JavaScript are variadic, and because
people take advantage of this (by relying on the number of arguments
provided for optional parameters or overloading the signature),
composition of such functions is not well-defined, and `curry` makes
things even less predictable for these cases.

Because of this, the use of `curry` for variadic functions is strongly
discouraged.

One also must consider the overhead of introducing `curry` in a codebase.
For most code, this overhead is negligible, but `curry` should be avoided
in code paths that require more performance.
